Project jointly done by Sharmitha Ganesan and Shelvin Pauly.

Run sharmitha_ganesan.py

Give the user inputs for starting coordinates,goal coordinates, theta and step size.
The radius and clearance are accounted for in the obstacle space.

Two test cases are :
start = 3,3
goal = 70,80
theta =30
step size = 3

start = 1,10
goal = 300,45
theta =60
step size = 5

The output videos for both cases are given in the videos folder.
